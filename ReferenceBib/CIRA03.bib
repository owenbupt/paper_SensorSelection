  mynote =" FZ``Fuzzy logic control (FLC) has become a popular approach
to reactive robot control in recent years [5]. Given
the uncertain and incomplete information an autonomous
robot has about the environment, fuzzy rules provide an attractive
means for mapping sensor data to appropriate control
actions in real time.

GA Evolutionary algorithms constitute a class of search and optimization methods guided by the principles of natural evolution and genetics.

Fuzzy+GA ``The GA-based approach is a well-accepted technique for enabling
systems to adapt to different control tasks [6] and there
is much work reported in the literature on designing fuzzy
controllers using GA [2], [4], [7]-[10], [12]-[14]. However,
virtually all this work was undertaken using simulation, as it
takes a large number of iterations to develop a good controller
in conventional GA.
%%%%%%%%%%%%
Thus, it is not feasible for a simple GA to learn online and adapt in real time.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The situation is worsened by the fact  that most evolutionary computation methods developed so far assume that the solution space is fixed (i.e., the evolution takes place within a predefined problem space, not in a dynamically changing and open one), thus preventing them from being used in real-time applications
[15]. Hence, prior to our work, it was not considered feasible for a robotic controller to learn and adapt online using simple GA [9] in outdoor unstructured environments.

We are using adaptive GA (AGA) mechanism,

stage of NN weights is required. The controller is capable of
disturbance-rejection in the presence of unmodeled bounded
disturbances. The tracking stability of the closed-loop system, the
convergence of the NN weight-updating process and boundedness
of NN weight estimation errors are all guaranteed. Experimental
tests on a four-DOF manipulator arm illustrate that the proposed

    title={A Localisation System for a High-Speed Land Vehicle},
    abstract={There has been a significant increase in the use of Autonomous Guided Vehicles
        (AGVs) in ports, mines and other primary industries. Many of these applications
        require vehicles which operate safely and efficiently in unstructured environments
        at speeds approaching those of human-controlled vehicles. Meeting these
        objectives is extremely difficult and arguably one of the most important
        requirements is an accurate and robust localisation system. In this paper
        we describe the development of a prototype, Kalman filter-based localisation
        system for a conventional road vehicle operating in an outdoor environment
        at speeds in excess of 15$\mps$. Using sparsely placed beacons, vehicle
        position can be resolved to the order of a metre. Three main themes are
        addressed. The first is a quantitative methodology for sensor suite design.
        Sensors are classified according to their frequency responses and the suite
        is chosen to ensure a uniform response across the spectrum of vehicle manoeuvres.
        The second theme develops accurate, high-order nonlinear models of vehicle
        motion which incorporate kinematics, dynamics and slip due to tyre deformation.
        Each model is useful within a certain operating regime. Outside of this
        regime the model can fail (for example, some states become unobservable)
        and the third theme avoids this problem through the use multiple models
        algorithms which synergistically fuse the properties of several models.
        Through addressing these themes we have developed a navigation system which
        has been shown to be accurate and robust to different types of road surface
        and occasional sensor data loss. The theories and principles developed
        in this paper are being used to develop a navigation system for commercial
        mining vehicles. },

                 on a table. The desired camera-joint mapping is
                 approximated by feedforward neural networks. However,
                 if the object is moving, the manipulator lags behind
                 because of the required time to preprocess the visual
                 information and to move the manipulator. Through the
                 use of time derivatives of the position of the object
                 and of the manipulator, the controller can inherently
                 predict the next position of the object. In this paper
                 several predictive controllers are proposed, and
                 successfully applied to track a moving object.",

  abstract={Many computer problems today need the computer power
that is only available using large scale parallel processing. For a
significant number of these problems, the density of the global communications
between the individual processors dominates the performance of the
whole parallel implementation on a distributed memory multiprocessor
system. In these cases, the design of the interconnection network for
the processors is known to play a significant part in the efficient
implementation of real problems. Networks of processors connected as
an irregular configuration have the advantage that they satisfy the
best known criteria for producing configurations that perform well
on real applications. This paper presents a new genetic algorithm for
the generation of optimal irregular configurations, which is a challenging
problem since there is no obvious representation which allows all the
main genetic operations to be implemented effectively.},
