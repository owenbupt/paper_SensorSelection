One among the several out growths of this work has been the development of a grammarbased approach to intelligent behavior generation for commanding autonomous robotic vehicles. In this paper we describe the use of this grammar for enabling autonomous behaviors. A supervisory task controller (STC) sequences high-level action commands (taken from the grammar) to be executed by the robot. It takes as input a set of goals and a partial (static) map of the environment and produces, from the grammar, a flexible script (or sequence) of the high-level commands that are to be executed by the robot. The sequence is derived by a planning function that uses a graph-based heuristic search (A* -algorithm). Each action command has specific exit conditions that are evaluated by the STC following each task completion or interruption (in the case of disturbances or new operator requests). Depending on the system¡¯s state at task completion or interruption (including updated environmental and robot sensor information), the STC invokes a reactive response. This can include sequencing the pending tasks or initiating a re-planning event, if necessary. Though applicable to a wide variety of autonomous robots, an application of this approach is demonstrated via simulations of ODIS, an omni-directional inspection system developed for security applications. Keywords: Intelligent behavior, supervisory control, path planning, autonomous mobile robots.

  abstract =     "In this paper, a new treatment of load uncertainties in structural problems based on fuzzy set
theory is introduced. A fuzzy finite-element method (FFEM) for treating uncertain loads in static structural
problems is developed. First, the problem is discretized, which results in a system of fuzzy algebraic equations.
An efficient algorithm for calculating guaranteed inclusions for the solution of such fuzzy systems is imple-mented.
In the case of uncertain loading, the resulting system of equations is linear, and only the right-hand
side vector contains fuzzy values. Solutions due to all load combinations, as a special case of load uncertainties,
can be obtained by a single computation, leading to a set of possible displacement values corresponding to all
loading cases. In conventional analysis, due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, calculating a possible
structural response for all possible loading combinations becomes computationally intractable for typical struc-tures.
Examples show that the possible interval values calculated using FFEM provide a sharp bound on possible
nodal displacements and element forces calculated by combinatorial calculation of all loading conditions. Thus
the extreme values of element forces for all loading combinations can be calculated using FFEM. Comparison
of the extreme values of element forces with typical design loading schemes show that the current design
procedures can lead to nonconservative predictions of element forces. The method therefore is applicable to
static analysis of any structural system that can be analyzed using finite-element methods.",

A classical approach to solve these problems, which satisfies the strong soundness requirement, involves some quantifier elimination procedure such as Collins' Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition symbolic method. Sound numerical methods using interval arithmetic and local consistency enforcement to prune the search space are presented in this paper as much faster alternatives for both soundly solving systems of nonlinear inequalities, and addressing the guaranteed tuning problem whenever the perturbation vector has dimension one. The use of these methods in camera control is investigated, and experiments with the prototype of a declarative modeller to express camera motion using a cinematic language are reported and commented.

Incorporating the shape of the Voronoi cell of a hexagonal lattice, they preserve the twelve-fold symmetry of the hexagon tiling cell. Similar to B-splines, we can use them to provide a link between the discrete and the continuous domain, which is required for many fundamental operations such as interpolation and resampling. The question we answer in this paper is ``How well do the hex-splines approximate a given function in the continuous domain?'' and more specifically ``How do they compare to separable B-splines deployed on a lattice with the same sampling density?''
