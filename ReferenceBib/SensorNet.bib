	 Re: How far does the 802.11b go View: Complete Thread (4 articles)
	 Original Format Newsgroups: microsoft.public.certification.mcse Date:
	 2002-05-22 04:57:28 PST Another 802.11b-related question is "Does the IEEE
	 802.11b protocol specification provide adequate security against
	 interception by wireless 'sniffing' with subsequent decryption?"
	 "Adequate" is an awkward technical word. A specification that provides
	 adequate security in the current technology and cost environment
	 might be inadequate against future technology advances and future
	 cost reductions. [Example: The evolution of Intel Corporation's x86
	 microprocessor series has provided orders of magnitude computing
	 power increases *without* significant cost increases. An adequate
	 specification in an 8086 environment is woefully *inadequate* in a Pentium
	 4 environment.] I believe that the widespread use of IPv4 and use
	 of "ten net" inside the firewall represents a basic vulnerability
	 to the IEEE 802.11b protocol security. This widespread use of "ten
	 net" means that many wireless networks have a predictable range of
	 IP addresses (e.g., 10.NNN.NNN.NNN decimal) inside the firewall.
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	 This IP address predictability supports construction of "wireless
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ intercept" cookbook software allowing non-expert hackers to
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ contruct flexible interception routines using prewritten
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	 algorithmic techniques. (In some circles an expert is defined as
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "anybody 50 miles from home with a briefcase". Guess what is in
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the briefcase.) Future
	 microprocessor and software advances might permit subsequent decryption at
	 affordable cost. The proposed IPv6 specification has a much greater
	 address range than IPv4 (use of "ten net" is not necessary in an IPv6
	 environment); and IPSec is a strong, built-in feature to the proposed IPv6
	 specification (rather than the IPv4 IPSec retrofit). I believe that the
	 combination use of the final IEEE 802.11b and the IPv6 specifications
	 will form a significant improvement to wireless networking security.
	 Achieving similar security in an IPv4 environment would be *very*
	 costly. Static IP addressing schemes (e.g., BOOT-P, or DHCP with
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ infinite time leases) facilitate wireless network interception.
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The text "IP Solutions for
	 Windows 2000" by Paul T. Ammann discusses DHCP manual, automatic, and
	 dynamic configuration plus DHCPv6 as implemented in Windows 2000.

	 standard is expected in 2004. Although Bluetooth is often suggested for
	 sensor network applications, the Bluetooth physical layer is not very
	 suitable for wireless sensor net- works. Frequency hopping spread
	 spectrum makes network discovery and association difficult because
	 the network and prospective member node are asynchronous and the
	 search must be done on a packet rate time scale. This causes a power
	 consumption problem as the prospective member searches the band for
	 the network, which may, in fact, not be present, and is especially
	 problematic for low duty rate systems. 3.2.2 IEEE 802.11b The IEEE
	 802.11b WLAN standard also specifies operation in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.
	 Although similar, regulations for the 2.4 GHz band are not the same
	 around the world: The standard provides for 14 overlapping channels of
	 22 MHz between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz. Not all channels are usable in all
	 regulatory areas; e.g., only channels 1 through 11 may be used in the
	 United States. Channel centers are spaced 5 MHz apart. The original
	 1- and 2-MHz direct sequence 802.11 physical layer is a pos- sible
	 candidate for a wireless sensor network; its hardware requirements are
	 simple, the data rate is high enough, and the use of direct sequence
	 means that it avoids the problems of frequency hopping systems. },

	 algorithms that alleviate generic problems such as highway congestion.
	 This is due to the fact that sensor network technology is a very
	 recent development. Since sensor networks are relatively new, not
	 many applications have been explored in depth. Utilizing the new
	 generation of TinyOS micaboard mote sensors, miniaturized sensors that
	 utilize TinyOS, an event-based operating environment written in code
	 similar to stylized C, the article focuses on how to achieve the best
	 possible data results from sensor network applications and setups for
	 traffic/highway goals. How to use sensor-network graphs for optimal
	 placement of sensors in a network so as to minimize work and to achieve
	 the best possible, and most accurate, signal-strength localization
	 measurements is also be a primary focus. Also discussed is a method that
	 optimizes the tradeoff between energy and accuracy using a variety of
	 activation policies. Finally, simulations and distancing experiments of
	 indoor and outdoor data are provided to encourage similar sensor work.},

  mynote = {In IEEE's proposed standard for wireless LANs (IEEE
	 802.11), there are two different ways to configure a network: ad-hoc
	 and infrastructure. In the ad-hoc network, computers are brought
	 together to form a network "on the fly." there is no structure to the
	 network; there are no fixed points; and usually every node is able to
	 communicate with every other node. A good example of this is the
	 aforementioned meeting where employees bring laptop computers together to
	 communicate and share design or financial information. Although it seems
	 that order would be difficult to maintain in this type of network,
	 algorithms such as the spokesman election algorithm (SEA) [4] have been
	 designed to "elect" one machine as the base station (master) of the
	 network with the others being slaves. Another algorithm in ad-hoc
	 network architectures uses a broadcast and flooding method to all other
	 nodes to establish who's who. the second type of network structure
	 used in wireless LANs is the infrastructure. This architecture uses
	 fixed network access points with which mobile nodes can communicate.
	 These network access points are sometime connected to landlines to
	 widen the LAN's capability by bridging wireless nodes to other wired
	 nodes. If service areas overlap, handoffs can occur. This structure is
	 very similar to the present day cellular networks around the world. },

  mynote = {Wi-Fi Last modified: Friday,
	 January 16, 2004 Short for wireless fidelity and is meant to be used
	 generically when referring of any type of 802.11 network, whether
	 802.11b, 802.11a, dual-band, etc. The term is promulgated by the Wi-Fi
	 Alliance. Any products tested and approved as "Wi-Fi Certified" (a
	 registered trademark) by the Wi-Fi Alliance are certified as interoperable
	 with each other, even if they are from different manufacturers. A
	 user with a "Wi-Fi Certified" product can use any brand of access
	 point with any other brand of client hardware that also is certified.
	 Typically, however, any Wi-Fi product using the same radio frequency
	 (for example, 2.4GHz for 802.11b or 11g, 5GHz for 802.11a) will work
	 with any other, even if not "Wi-Fi Certified." Formerly, the term
	 "Wi-Fi" was used only in place of the 2.4GHz 802.11b standard, in
	 the same way that "Ethernet" is used in place of IEEE 802.3. The
	 Alliance expanded the generic use of the term in an attempt to stop
	 confusion about wireless LAN interoperability. Also see the Wireless
	 LAN Standards chart in the Quick Reference section of Webopedia.},
