	Have CA been used to model ant behavior?
			
	

Contributions by:

Bauchau, Vincent" <bauchau@cto.nioo.nl> Perry Wagle <wagle@cs.indiana.edu>

Most models of ants (and other social insects) are not strictly CA since the rules of behavior are associated with elements that move, rather than with a site in space. However, there are many basic questions ("How do simple local rules give rise to global complex behavior?") which apply equally well to CA and ant models.

The definitive book on ants is: Wilson E.O. and Holldobler B 1990 The Ants. Springer, 732 pp, 1000 ill. (This book won the Pullitzer price.)

"A Parallel Distributed Model of the Behaviour of Ant Colonies" D.M. Gordon, B.C. Goodwin and L.E.H. Trainor, J theor Biol (1992) 156, 293-307. Models the dynamics of task-switching in harvester ants.

Hello,

I would like to know applications of cellular automatas apart of all related
to artificial life. Now I'm studying a course of cellular automata and the
teacher ask us to write a small paper about uses of this technology and to
implement a little application that demonstrates this uses.

But I would like to do something different from artificial life that it
seems to be the tipical application. I've seen that cell automata are used
in demonstrations of financial process but I didn't find much information
about it.

If somebody could help me, it would be very appreciated.

Best regards

Hello Lius

In this Link:

http://cafaq.com/apps/index.ph p

you will can obtain some information about your question, also in:

http://www.stephenwolfram.com/ publications/articles/ca/

there is a bit of information on:

-Random Sequence Generation
-Thermodynamics and Hydrodynamics with Cellular Automata
-Cryptography with Cellular Automata

I hope these links help you.

Luis:

Generally, cellular automata are data-flow Turing machines.  Hence,
they are computationally equivalent to any other computer.  Their
operations are not typical of the computer you probably used to
post your message to this group; that is, they are not of a design
that is serial in nature.  They are parallel processors.  Indeed, they
are the original explication of parallel computation.

Not all cellular automata are Turing complete.

Once upon a time I worked for a small research group at MIT that built
the CAM8 Cellular Autotmat Supercomputer.  Great piece of hardware !!  I
don't think there are any still functional anywhere since the host
computer (old Sun SPARC machines) isn't made anymore.  I located an
archive of the Information Mechanics web site which has some interesting
applications from '94: http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects /im/broch/

I spent a little time working at Hanscom AFB with a researcher who is
building Type II Quantum Computers.  He was a visiting scientist with
the IM Group and one of the first things he did with his Q-Computer was
to implement a Quantum Cellular Automata (a Lattice Gas to be precise).
  Check out the link for some of his papers: http://qubit.plh.af.mil/

If I ever have time I want to get back to CA research.  I started a
project to try to preserve a lot of the code that was written at MIT,
Hanscom and other labs.  I haven't had any time to work on it... but I'm
hoping I eventually will :-)
