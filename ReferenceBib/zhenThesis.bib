	 developed for solving the multi-line fitting problem in a two dimensional

	 estimation framework such that a first order or a second order polynomial
	 phase signal structure is obtained. Then, the recently developed
	 algorithms in that formalism can be exploited to produce accurate
	 estimates for line parameters. The signal representation employed in
	 this formulation can be generalized to handle both problems of line
	 fitting (in which a set of binary valued discrete pixels is given)
	 and straight edge detection (in which one starts with a grey scale
	 image). A main advantage of the proposed method is its ability to
	 estimate the parameters of parallel lines with different offsets
	 which can not be handled by the sensor array processing technique
	 introduced by Aghajan et al. Simulation results are presented to
	 demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. %%submitted toDec 1997},

	 wheeled mobile robot equipped with an advanced sonar sensor. The
	 original mapping navigation experiment, carried out with the same robot
	 configuration, builds a feature map consisting of commonplace indoor landmarks
	 crucial for localization, namely planes, corners and edges. The map
	 exhaustively maintains covariance matrices among all features, thus
	 presents a time and memory impediment to practical navigation in
	 large environments. The new local mapping strategy proposed here
	 breaks down a large environment into a topology of local regions, only
	 maintaining the covariance among features in the same local region, and the
	 covariance among local maps. This notion of two hierarchy representation
	 drastically improves the memory and processing time requirements
	 of the original global approach, while preserving the statistical
	 details, in the authors?? opinions, necessary for an accurate map and
	 prolonged navigation. The new local mapping scheme also extends the
	 endeavour towards reducing error accumulation made in the global
	 mapping strategy by eliminating errors accumulated between visits
	 to the same part of the environment. This is achieved with a map
	 matching strategy developed exclusively for the advanced sonar sensor
	 employed. The local mapping strategy has been tested in two large, real
	 life indoor environments and successful results are reported here.},

  abstract = {One of the critical components of mapping an unknown environment
	 is the robot??s ability to locate itself on a partially explored
	 map. This becomes challenging when the robot experiences positioning
	 error, does not have an external positioning device, nor the luxury of
	 engineered landmarks placed in its free space. This paper presents a new
	 method for simultaneous localization and mapping that exploits the
	 topology of the robot??s free space to localize the robot on a partially
	 constructed map. The topology of the environment is encoded in a
	 topological map; the particular topological map used in this paper is
	 the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG), which also encodes some metric
	 information about the robot??s environment, as well. In this paper,
	 we present the low-level control laws that generate the GVG edges
	 and nodes, thereby allowing for exploration of an unknown space.
	 With these prescribed control laws, the GVG (or other topological
	 map) can be viewed as an arbitrator for a hybrid control system that
	 determines when to invoke a particular low-level controller from a
	 set of controllers all working toward the high-level capability of
	 mobile robot exploration. The main contribution, however, is using
	 the graph structure of the GVG, via a graph matching process, to
	 localize the robot. Experimental results verify the described work. },

  abstract = {To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot
	 must know where it is. This includes both the ability of globally
	 localizing the robot from scratch, as well as tracking the robot's
	 position once its location is known. Vision has long been advertised as
	 providing a solution to these problems, but we still lack efficient
	 solutions in unmodified environments. Many existing approaches require
	 modification of the environment to function properly, and those that
	 work within unmodified environments seldomly address the problem of
	 global localization. In this paper we present a novel, vision-based
	 localization method based on the Condensation algorithm (Isard 96,Isard
	 98), a Bayesian filtering method that uses a sampling-based density
	 representation. We show how the Condensation algorithm can be used in a
	 novel way to track the position of the camera platform rather than
	 tracking an object in the scene. In addition, it can also be used to
	 globally localize the camera platform, given a visual map of the
	 environment. Based on these two observations, we present a vision-based
	 robot localization method that provides a solution to a difficult and
	 open problem in the mobile robotics community. As evidence for the
	 viability of our approach, we show both global localization and tracking
	 results in the context of a state of the art robotics application.},

  abstract = {For mobile robots to be successful, they have to navigate
	 safely in populated and dynamic environments. While recent research
	 has led to a variety of localization methods that can track robots
	 well in {\em static} environments, we still lack methods that can
	 robustly localize mobile robots in dynamic environments, where, for
	 example, people may block the robot's sensors for extensive periods of
	 time. This paper proposes a family of probabilistic algorithms that
	 can localize mobile robots even in densely populated environments.
	 These algorithms are based on Markov localization, which estimates
	 the location of a robot probabilistically. A novel entropy-based
	 filter is employed for determining the "believability" of a sensor
	 reading, thereby filtering out sensor readings that are corrupted
	 by humans or unexpected changes in the environment. The technique
	 was recently implemented and applied as part of an installation,
	 in which a mobile robot gave interactive tours to visitors of the
	 ``Deutsches Museum Bonn.'' Extensive empirical tests involving datasets
	 recorded during peak traffic hours in the museum demonstrate that this
	 approach is able to accurately estimate the robot's position in more
	 than 99\% of the cases even in such highly dynamic environments. },

	 This paper presents the design of a high accuracy outdoor navigation
	 system based on standard dead reckoning sensors and laser range and
	 bearing information. The data validation problem is addressed using
	 laser intensity information. The beacon design aspect and location of
	 landmarks are also discussed in relation to desired accuracy and
	 required area of operation. The results are important for simultaneous
	 localization ? . and map building applications SLAM , since the feature
	 extraction and validation are resolved at the sensor level using laser
	 intensity. This facilitates the use of additional natural landmarks to
	 improve the accuracy of the localization algorithm. The modeling
	 aspects to implement SLAM with beacons and natural features are also
	 presented. These results are of fundamental importance because the
	 implementation of the algorithm does not require the surveying of beacons.
	 Furthermore we demonstrate that by using natural landmarks accurate
	 localization can be achieved by only requiring the initial estimate of the
	 position of the vehicle. The algorithms are validated in outdoor
	 environments using a standard utility car retrofitted with the navigation
	 sensors and a 1 cm precision Kinematic GPS used as ground truth.},

  abstract = {We propose an original method for robotic programming based on bayesian inference and
	 learning. This method formally deals with problems of uncertainty and
	 incomplete information that are inherent to the field. Indeed, the
	 principal difficulties of robot programming comes from the unavoidable
	 incompleteness of the models used. We present the formalism for describing a
	 robotic task as well as the resolution methods. This formalism is
	 inspired by the theory of the probability calculus, suggested by
	 the physicist E T Jaynes: ``Probability as Logic''[1]. Learning and
	 maximum entropy principle translate incompleteness into uncertainty.
	 Bayesian inference offers a formal framework for reasoning with this
	 uncertainty. There is quite a lot of experimental work involving
	 programming robots to act under uncertainty, based on Bayesian inference :
	 See for instance [2,3,4]. These works effectively use the Bayesian
	 approach for accomplishing robot tasks, but they do not present a
	 structured programming paradigm as the current paper does. The main
	 contribution of this paper is the definition of a generic system of robotic
	 programming and its experimental application. We illustrate it by
	 programming a surveillance task with a mobile robot: The Khepera.
	 In order to do this, we use generic programming resources called
	 "descriptions". We show how to define and use these resources in
	 an incremental way (reactive behaviors, sensor fusion, situation
	 recognition and sequences of behaviors) within a systematic and unified
	 framework. We discuss the various advantages of our approach: Statement of
	 preliminary knowledge, taking into account uncertainty, direct and inverse
	 programming. We place our work within a wider epistemological horizon
	 while opposing, within the framework of autonomous robotics, the
	 "traditional" approach concerning "high level cognition" and the "reactive"
	 approach associated with the "low level cognition". We finally show how
	 our work proposes to establish a link between these two extremes. },

  abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings
	 is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous
	 robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the
	 very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman
	 filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the
	 number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This
	 paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the
	 full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations,
	 yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map.
	 This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a
	 product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution
	 over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many
	 as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous
	 approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations
	 of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data. },

	 Maximum Likelihood Estimates of the parameters using the EM algorithm,
	 extending previous results on learning using EM in the non-switching case
	 [DRO93, GH96a] and in the switching, but fully observed, case [Ham90]. },

  abstract = {Mobile robot localization is the
	 problem of determining a robot's pose from sensor data. Monte Carlo
	 Localization is a family of algorithms for localization based on
	 particle filters, which are approximate Bayes filters that use random
	 samples for posterior estimation. Recently, they have been applied
	 with great success for robot localization. Unfortunately, regular
	 particle filters perform poorly in certain situations. Mixture-MCL,
	 the algorithm described here, overcomes these problems by using a
	 ``dual'' sampler, integrating two complimentary ways of generating
	 samples in the estimation. To apply this algorithm for mobile robot
	 localization, a kd-tree is learned from data that permits fast dual
	 sampling. Systematic empirical results obtained using data collected in
	 crowded public places illustrate superior performance, robustness, and
	 efficiency, when compared to other state-of-the-art localization
	 algorithms. He thought: The nature of small, incremental errors makes
	 algorithms such as Kalman filters [28,37,47,68] applicable, which
	 have been successfully applied in a range of fielded systems (e.g.,
	 [27,44,42,63]). Kalman filters estimate posterior distributions of robot
	 poses conditioned on sensor data. Exploiting a range of restrictive
	 assumptions??such as Gaussian-distributed noise and Gaussiandistributed
	 initial uncertainty??they represent posteriors by Gaussians. Kalman
	 filters offer an elegant and efficient algorithm for localization.
	 However, the restrictive nature of the belief representation makes
	 plain Kalman filters inapplicable to global localization problems.
	 This limitation is overcome by two related families of algorithms:
	 Localization with multi-hypothesis Kalman filters and Markov localization.
	 Multi-hypothesis Kalman filters represent beliefs using mixtures of Gaussians
	 [9,34,60,61], thereby enabling them to pursue multiple, distinct
	 hypotheses, each of which is represented by a separate Gaussian.
	 However, this approach inherits from Kalman filters the Gaussian
	 noise assumption. To meet this assumption, virtually all practical
	 implementations extract low-dimensional features from the sensor data, thereby
	 ignoring much of the information acquired by a robot??s sensors. Markov
	 localization algorithms, in contrast, represent beliefs by piecewise
	 constant functions (histograms) over the space of all possible poses
	 [7,24,30,36,40,50,55,56,66,70].\url{http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/thrun/public_html/papers.html} },

	 posterior estimation. Recently, they have been applied with great
	 success for robot localization. Unfortunately, regular particle filters
	 perform poorly in certain situations. Mixture-MCL, the algorithm
	 described here, overcomes these problems by using a "dual" sampler,
	 integrating two complimentary ways of generating samples in the estimation.
	 To apply this algorithm for mobile robot localization, a kd-tree
	 is learned from data that permits fast dual sampling. Systematic
	 empirical results obtained using data collected in crowded public
	 places illustrate superior performance, robustness, and efficiency,
	 when compared to other state-of-the-art localization algorithms. },

	 samples, along with density trees generated from such samples. A Monte
	 Carlo version of Baum-Welch (EM) is employed to learn models from
	 data. Regularization during learning is achieved using an exponential
	 shrinking technique. The shrinkage factor, which determines the effective
	 capacity of the learning algorithm, is annealed down over multiple
	 iterations of Baum-Welch, and early stopping is applied to select the
	 right model. Once trained, Monte Carlo HMMs can be run in an any-time
	 fashion. We prove that under mild assumptions, Monte Carlo Hidden
	 Markov Models converge to a local maximum in likelihood space, just
	 like conventional HMMs. In addition, we provide empirical results
