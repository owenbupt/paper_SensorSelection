Abstract:
In
	this paper we present a new approach for natural feature extraction
	using a laser scanner for the purpose of localization in outdoor
	environments. In semi-structured outdoor environments, naturally
	predominant features such as trees and edges are considered. The
	proposed method applies a batch processing which carries out feature
	extraction after measurements from a full scan are received. The
	algorithm consists of data segmentation and parameter acquisition.
	A modified Gauss-Newton method is proposed for fitting circle parameters
	iteratively. The natural features extracted through this approach
	are more robust than those obtained by existing methods. In order
	to reduce the estimation error caused by the linearization in the
	extended Kalman filtering (EKF), a particle filter is applied to
	realize the prediction and validation by integrating data from both
	the laser range sensor and encoder in outdoor environments. The proposed
	feature extraction and localization algorithms are verified in a
	real world experiment.},

The
	trend in localization is towards using more and more detailed models
	of the world. Our aim has been to answer the question "How simple
	a model can be used to provide and maintain pose information in an
	in-door setting?". In this paper a Kalman filter based method for
	continuous position updating using a laser scanner is presented.
	By updating the position at a high frequency the matching problem
	becomes tractable and outliers can effectively be filtered out by
	means of validation gates. Presented experimental results show that
	the method performs very well in an in-door environment.
