	{<div>This manual offers practical advice on the fundamentals of
	research to college and university students in all fields of study.
	<i>The Craft of Research</i> teaches much more than the mechanics
	of fact gathering: it explains how to approach a research project
	as an analytical process. The authors chart every stage of research,
	from finding a topic and generating research questions about it
	to marshalling evidence, constructing arguments, and writing everything
	up in a final report that is a model of authority. Their advice
	is designed for use by both beginners and seasoned practitioners,

	to the distinctive nature, values, and protocols of research. Part
	Two demystifies the art of discovering a topic. It outlines a wide
	range of sources, among them personal interests and passions. Parts
	Three and Four cover the essentials of argument--how to make a claim
	and support it--and ways to outline, draft, revise, rewrite, and
	polish the final report. Part Three is a short course in the logic,
	structure, uses, and common pitfalls of argumentation. The writing
	chapters in Part Four show how to present verbal and visual information
	effectively and how to shape sentences and paragraphs that communicate
	with power and precision.<br><br>"A well-constructed, articulate
	reminder of how important fundamental questions of style and approach,

	{<div>Since 1995, more than 150,000 students and researchers have
	turned to <i>The Craft of Research</i> for clear and helpful guidance
	on how to conduct research and report it effectively . Now, master
	teachers Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, and Joseph M. Williams
	present a completely revised and updated version of their classic
	handbook.<br><br>Like its predecessor, this new edition reflects
	the way researchers actually work: in a complex circuit of thinking,
	writing, revising, and rethinking. It shows how each part of this
	process influences the others and how a successful research report
	is an orchestrated conversation between a researcher and a reader.
	Along with many other topics, <i>The Craft of Research</i> explains
	how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim;
	how to anticipate the reservations of thoughtful yet critical readers
	and to respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions
	and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, "So what?"<br><br>Celebrated
	by reviewers for its logic and clarity, this popular book retains
	its five-part structure. Part 1 provides an orientation to the research
	process and begins the discussion of what motivates researchers
	and their readers. Part 2 focuses on finding a topic, planning the
	project, and locating appropriate sources. This section is brought
	up to date with new information on the role of the Internet in research,
	including how to find and evaluate sources, avoid their misuse,
	and test their reliability. <br><br>Part 3 explains the art of making
	an argument and supporting it. The authors have extensively revised
	this section to present the structure of an argument in clearer
	and more accessible terms than in the first edition. New distinctions
	are made among <i>reasons</i>, <i>evidence</i>, and <i>reports of
	evidence</i>. The concepts of <i>qualifications and rebuttals</i>
	are recast as <i>acknowledgment and response</i>. Part 4 covers
	drafting and revising, and offers new information on the visual
	representation of data. Part 5 concludes the book with an updated
	discussion of the ethics of research, as well as an expanded bibliography
	that includes many electronic sources. <br><br>The new edition retains
	the accessibility, insights, and directness that have made <i>The
	Craft of Research</i> an indispensable guide for anyone doing research,
	from students in high school through advanced graduate study to

	convincingly that researching and reporting skills can be learned

	Optimum design theory for regression experiments is consequently
	employed to assess and construct monitoring networks for these processes.
	However, straightforward application of much of this theory is not
	possible, since the typical assumption of independent errors is
	violated. In the present article I intend to give an overview on
	design methods that attempt to cope with the problem, amongst them
	two recently developed approaches. For a comparison the techniques
	will be applied to the design of a water-quality monitoring network
	in the Südliche Tullnerfeld in Lower Austria. Copyright © 2005 John

  year = {2004},
  volume = {7},
  abstract = {Ad hoc wireless networks are power constrained since nodes operate
	with limited battery energy. Thus, energy consumption is crucial
	in the design of new ad hoc routing protocols. To design such protocols,
	we have to look away from the traditional minimum, hop routing schemes.
	In this, paper, we propose three extensions to the state-of-the-art
	shortest-cost routing algorithm, AODV. The discovery mechanism in
	these extensions (LEAR-AODV, PAR-AODV, and LPR-AODV) uses energy
	consumption as a routing metric. They reduce the energy consumption
	of the nodes by routing packets to their destination using energy-optimal
	routes. We show that these algorithms improve the network survivability
	by maintaining the network connectivity. They carry out this objective
	with low overhead and without affecting the other wireless network
	protocol layers.},

  year = {2004},

  abstract = {In this paper, we proposed an energy conserving routing protocol in
	mobile ad hoc network. The goal of our protocol is to reduce power
	consumption in transmission and hence to increase the lifetime of
	the whole network. To achieve energy conservation, the transmission
	power is controlled to the minimum level that packets can be correctly
	received. To find a proper route, we take into account both the
	transmission power and the remaining energy of the mobile hosts
	along the path. We also proposed a route caching strategy to increase
	the cache efficiency. Simulation results show that our protocol
	can conserve 10% to 20% more energy than dynamic source routing
	does. Also, our protocol also have not only longer network lifetime
	but also lower standard deviation on remaining energy among hosts.},

	to prepare and refer to tables and illustrations. The section on
	documentation, chapters 8-12, describes two of the most commonly
	used systems of citation; these chapters provide many examples including
	guidance on how to cite electronic documents. Chapter 13, on manuscript
	preparation, shows how to take advantage of word processing software

	14 offers more than two dozen sample pages illustrating ways of
