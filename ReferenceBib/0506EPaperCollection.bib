	model via autonomous wireless sensor networks is studied in this

	of PDE model parameters rather than raw sensor measurements. Then,
	the base station can reconstruct the phenomenon through model parameters
	and initial and boundary conditions. In-network processing techniques
	to estimate the PDE coefficients are presented. A scheme is presented
	to provide a hybrid combination of decision and data fusion to find
	a proper tradeoff between estimate accuracy and energy efficiency.
	Besides, several open issues in this research context, such as identifiability
	of parameters, monitoring of time varying boundary conditions and

  title = {Information limits in remote sensing and target tracking},
  school = {The University of Connecticut},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {In this research we focus on information limits in the remote sensing
	and target tracking field. Three topics are studied: a dynamic Cramér-Rao
	bound for target tracking in clutter, target intervisibility, and
	monopulse radar detection and localization of multiple unresolved
	targets via joint bin processing.
	
	
	We develop a Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for target tracking, that
	is, for the state estimates of dynamic systems in the presence of
	false alarms and missed detections. We show that the CRLB obeys
	a Riccati-like equation, with the exception that the measurement-noise
	covariance term is multiplied by an information reduction factor
	(IRF). The calculation of the IRF and the existence of efficient
	estimators are also addressed.
	
	
	In the second topic we study intervisibility---the existence of an
	unobstructed line of sight (LOS) between two points---accounting
	for the vertical and horizontal errors in the estimated locations
	of both points as well as elevation errors in the database of the
	terrain that could obstruct the LOS between these points. This is
	a significant factor in limiting information gathering in real systems.
	The errors will first be simply treated as a "white" noise sequence:
	we assume no correlation between the intervisibility at two different
	times, and the probability of an instantaneous intervisibility event
	will be in this case developed. Consequently, we will present a
	second treatment in which the errors are stochastic processes of
	a certain bandwidth, and both the probability density function of
	an intervisibility interval and the average number of intervisibility
	intervals over a certain time period will be developed.
	
	
	In a monopulse radar system, if several closely-spaced targets fall
	within the same radar beam and between two adjacent matched filter
	samples in range, the monopulse information from both of these samples
	can and should be used for estimation, both of angle and of range
	(i.e., estimation of the range to sub-bin accuracy). In our research,
	a model of closely spaced targets that fall between adjacent matched
	filter samples is established and a maximum likelihood (ML) extractor
	will be developed. The limits on the number of targets that can
	be estimated are given. A minimum description length (MDL) criterion
	is used to decide on the number of targets between the matched filter
	samples.},

	formulation can be generalized to handle both problems of line fitting
	(in which a set of binary valued discrete pixels is given) and straight
	edge detection (in which one starts with a grey scale image). A
	main advantage of the proposed method is its ability to estimate
	the parameters of parallel lines with different offsets which can
	not be handled by the sensor array processing technique introduced
	by Aghajan et al. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate
	the usefulness of the proposed method. %%submitted toDec 1997},

  title = {Target-tracking and identity management algorithms for air traffic
	surveillance},
  school = {Stanford University},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The air traffic control system of the United States is responsible
	for managing traffic in the National Airspace System; safety is
	a paramount concern. The air traffic surveillance network has the
	task of collecting and processing information on the positions,
	velocities and identities of the aircraft in the system, before
	presenting it to air traffic controllers to use in maintaining an
	orderly flow of traffic.
	
	
	This dissertation attempts to design techniques that provide controllers
	with high-fidelity information about the aircraft in their controlled
	airspace, using the observations of the air traffic surveillance
	network. We propose algorithms for the efficient tracking of aircraft,
	as well as for maintaining beliefs of their identities. Such methods
	would improve the processing of aircraft situation data, particularly
	in a congested airspace with general aviation.
	
	
	In this thesis, we propose an algorithmic framework for the simultaneous
	tracking and identity management of multiple maneuvering targets.
	We design an algorithm that efficiently tracks the positions, velocities,
	flight modes, and identities of multiple aircraft in cluttered environments.
	We tackle the challenges of data association, identity management
	and state estimation of aircraft trajectories by proposing a modification
	of the Joint Probabilistic Data Association algorithm, an algorithm
	based on identity-mass flow, and a state estimation algorithm for
	tracking hybrid systems, respectively.
	
	
	The identity of each aircraft, an essential feature of aircraft situation
	data, is often not available but needs to be inferred from radar
	observations, and maintained in terms of probabilities. We present
	an algorithm to update the probabilistic matrices that represent
	the belief of aircraft identities, in the presence of intermittent
	measurements. We demonstrate the performance of the framework using
	examples drawn from air traffic surveillance.
	
	
	We also consider the problem of identifying stochastic hybrid systems
	models from time series data. We propose an algorithm that, given
	air traffic surveillance data, can provide a model for tracking
	aircraft trajectories. The proposed parameter inference algorithm
	for stochastic linear hybrid systems finds a maximum-likelihood
	model given only the continuous output data of the system. We demonstrate
	this technique on several examples, including flight test data from
	the Stanford DragonFly Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.},

	Re: How far does the 802.11b go View: Complete Thread (4 articles)
	Original Format Newsgroups: microsoft.public.certification.mcse
	Date: 2002-05-22 04:57:28 PST Another 802.11b-related question is
	"Does the IEEE 802.11b protocol specification provide adequate security
	against interception by wireless 'sniffing' with subsequent decryption?"
	"Adequate" is an awkward technical word. A specification that provides
	adequate security in the current technology and cost environment
	might be inadequate against future technology advances and future
	cost reductions. [Example: The evolution of Intel Corporation's
	x86 microprocessor series has provided orders of magnitude computing
	power increases *without* significant cost increases. An adequate
	specification in an 8086 environment is woefully *inadequate* in
	a Pentium 4 environment.] I believe that the widespread use of IPv4
	and use of "ten net" inside the firewall represents a basic vulnerability
	to the IEEE 802.11b protocol security. This widespread use of "ten
	net" means that many wireless networks have a predictable range
	of IP addresses (e.g., 10.NNN.NNN.NNN decimal) inside the firewall.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This IP address predictability supports construction of "wireless
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	intercept" cookbook software allowing non-expert hackers to ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	contruct flexible interception routines using prewritten ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	algorithmic techniques. (In some circles an expert is defined as
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"anybody 50 miles from home with a briefcase". Guess what is in
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the briefcase.)
	Future microprocessor and software advances might permit subsequent
	decryption at affordable cost. The proposed IPv6 specification has
	a much greater address range than IPv4 (use of "ten net" is not
	necessary in an IPv6 environment); and IPSec is a strong, built-in
	feature to the proposed IPv6 specification (rather than the IPv4
	IPSec retrofit). I believe that the combination use of the final
	IEEE 802.11b and the IPv6 specifications will form a significant
	improvement to wireless networking security. Achieving similar security
	in an IPv4 environment would be *very* costly. Static IP addressing
	schemes (e.g., BOOT-P, or DHCP with ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	infinite time leases) facilitate wireless network interception.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The text "IP Solutions for Windows 2000" by Paul T. Ammann discusses
	DHCP manual, automatic, and dynamic configuration plus DHCPv6 as
	implemented in Windows 2000. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	of a plant being sufficiently rich or persistently excited is extended

	established under the additional assumption that the plant is persistently

	involving the estimation of both constant and functional parameters
	in one-dimensional linear and nonlinear heat or diffusion equations
	and the estimation of stiffness and damping parameters in a one-dimensional

	Rockwell Automation October 2001. DeviceNet? and ControlNet? are
	two well-known industrial networks based on the CIP protocol (CIP
	= Control an Information Protocol). Both networks have been developed
	by Rockwell Automation, but are now owned and maintained by the
	two manufacturer's organizations ODVA (Open DeviceNet Vendors Association)

	have recently introduced the newest member of this family ? EtherNet/IP
	("IP" stands for "Industrial Protocol"). This paper describes the
	techniques and mechanisms that are used to implement a fully consistent
	set of services and data objects on a TCP/UDP/IP based Ethernet?
	network. Networks that can provide all three services ? control,
	configuration, and collection of data ? deliver the greatest amount
	of flexibility and efficiency for better overall system performance.
	Older automation networks use the source/destination model of communication.
	With this strategy, your: throughput and productivity were directly
	tied to how quickly a master device updated its I/O. configuration
	capabilities were extremely limited, if available at all. performance
	was reduced since you spent a lot of time programming controllers
	to collect and distribute data for you. Networks in the NetLinx
	Open Network Architecture ? DeviceNet, ControlNet, and EtherNet/IP
	networks ? use today's technology, the producer/consumer communication
	model. With this strategy, your: devices can send and receive data

	process was the creation of a standard Transducer Electronic Data
	Sheet (TEDS) in IEEE 1451.2.11 This standard facilitated the use
	of smart sensors by standardizing the interface between the sensors
	and the "Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP)" (i.e., the
	protocol-handling pro- cessor between the sensor and the network).
	As part of this standardiza- tion, the TEDS was created to provide
	a way in which the transducers can describe themselves to measurement
	systems, control systems, and, in general any device on the network.
	Representation of almost every con- The latest 1451 standard, the
	wireless sensor standard 1451.5, is now under development. Balloting
	for this standard is expected in 2004. Although Bluetooth is often
	suggested for sensor network applications, the Bluetooth physical
	layer is not very suitable for wireless sensor net- works. Frequency
	hopping spread spectrum makes network discovery and association
	difficult because the network and prospective member node are asynchronous
	and the search must be done on a packet rate time scale. This causes
	a power consumption problem as the prospective member searches the
	band for the network, which may, in fact, not be present, and is
	especially problematic for low duty rate systems. 3.2.2 IEEE 802.11b
	The IEEE 802.11b WLAN standard also specifies operation in the 2.4
	GHz ISM band. Although similar, regulations for the 2.4 GHz band
	are not the same around the world: The standard provides for 14
	overlapping channels of 22 MHz between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz. Not all
	channels are usable in all regulatory areas; e.g., only channels
	1 through 11 may be used in the United States. Channel centers are
	spaced 5 MHz apart. The original 1- and 2-MHz direct sequence 802.11
	physical layer is a pos- sible candidate for a wireless sensor network;
	its hardware requirements are simple, the data rate is high enough,
	and the use of direct sequence means that it avoids the problems
	of frequency hopping systems. }

	using a wheeled mobile robot equipped with an advanced sonar sensor.
	The original mapping navigation experiment, carried out with the
	same robot configuration, builds a feature map consisting of commonplace
	indoor landmarks crucial for localization, namely planes, corners
	and edges. The map exhaustively maintains covariance matrices among
	all features, thus presents a time and memory impediment to practical
	navigation in large environments. The new local mapping strategy
	proposed here breaks down a large environment into a topology of
	local regions, only maintaining the covariance among features in
	the same local region, and the covariance among local maps. This
	notion of two hierarchy representation drastically improves the
	memory and processing time requirements of the original global approach,
	while preserving the statistical details, in the authors?? opinions,
	necessary for an accurate map and prolonged navigation. The new
	local mapping scheme also extends the endeavour towards reducing
	error accumulation made in the global mapping strategy by eliminating
	errors accumulated between visits to the same part of the environment.
	This is achieved with a map matching strategy developed exclusively
	for the advanced sonar sensor employed. The local mapping strategy
	has been tested in two large, real life indoor environments and
	successful results are reported here.},

	the robot??s ability to locate itself on a partially explored map.
	This becomes challenging when the robot experiences positioning
	error, does not have an external positioning device, nor the luxury
	of engineered landmarks placed in its free space. This paper presents
	a new method for simultaneous localization and mapping that exploits
	the topology of the robot??s free space to localize the robot on
	a partially constructed map. The topology of the environment is
	encoded in a topological map; the particular topological map used
	in this paper is the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG), which also
	encodes some metric information about the robot??s environment,
	as well. In this paper, we present the low-level control laws that
	generate the GVG edges and nodes, thereby allowing for exploration
	of an unknown space. With these prescribed control laws, the GVG
	(or other topological map) can be viewed as an arbitrator for a
	hybrid control system that determines when to invoke a particular
	low-level controller from a set of controllers all working toward
	the high-level capability of mobile robot exploration. The main
	contribution, however, is using the graph structure of the GVG,
	via a graph matching process, to localize the robot. Experimental

  abstract = {This technical report presents a new approach for estimating in real-time
	the parameters of the advection-diffusion equation that describes
	the propagation of an instantaneously released gas. A team of mobile
	robots equipped with appropriate sensing devices is used for the
	collection of chemical agent concentration. In addition, each of
	the robots has a sensitive anemometric vane for measuring the velocity
	and the direction of the wind. The selection of the set of locations
	where the measurements are recorded is based on the minimization
	of uncertainty of the estimated parameters and on reducing the time
	to convergence of this estimation problem. Simulation results are
	presented that validate the described approach, which has significantly
	lower computational requirements compared to alternative motion
	strategies based on exhaustive global search. REFERENCES [1] A.

  abstract = {To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know
	where it is. This includes both the ability of globally localizing
	the robot from scratch, as well as tracking the robot's position
	once its location is known. Vision has long been advertised as providing
	a solution to these problems, but we still lack efficient solutions
	in unmodified environments. Many existing approaches require modification
	of the environment to function properly, and those that work within
	unmodified environments seldomly address the problem of global localization.
	In this paper we present a novel, vision-based localization method
	based on the Condensation algorithm (Isard 96,Isard 98), a Bayesian
	filtering method that uses a sampling-based density representation.
	We show how the Condensation algorithm can be used in a novel way
	to track the position of the camera platform rather than tracking
	an object in the scene. In addition, it can also be used to globally
	localize the camera platform, given a visual map of the environment.
	Based on these two observations, we present a vision-based robot
	localization method that provides a solution to a difficult and
	open problem in the mobile robotics community. As evidence for the
	viability of our approach, we show both global localization and
	tracking results in the context of a state of the art robotics application.},

  abstract = {Locating gradient sources and tracking them over time has important
	applications to environmental monitoring and studies of the ecosystem.
	We present an approach, inspired by bacterial chemotaxis, for robots
	to navigate to sources using gradient measurements and a simple
	actuation strategy (biasing a random walk). Extensive simulations
	show the efficacy of the approach in varied conditions including
	multiple sources, dissipative sources, and noisy sensors and actuators.
	We also show how such an approach could be used for boundary finding.
	We validate our approach by testing it on a small robot (the robomote)
	in a phototaxis experiment. A comparison of our approach with gradient
	descent shows that while gradient descent is faster, our approach
	is better suited for boundary coverage, and performs better in the
	presence of multiple and dissipative sources. Previous approaches
	to location and tracking of gradient sources include spiral surge
	[1], gradient seek [5], sensor arrays [6], swarm intelligence [7].
	These approaches are good for application in nearly static environments.
	Most of these approaches have difficulties tracking sources that
	are small, weak, mobile or sources whose intensity varies with time.
	The gradient seeking strategies are susceptible to local minima
	and plateaus. In the presence of multiple sources they are able
	to locate and proceed to the closest source enacting a greedy solution.

	Sensor networks have a wide spectrum of applicability, including

	we study the applicability of sensors to ocean related disaster
	management. We present sensors on sea (SOS); a simple, novel, best-effort

	low-power wireless sensors. SOS strives to progressively and collaboratively
	build an aggregated global knowledge of sensor measurements, which
	can be reported to a pick-up station, once a sensor is within transmission
	range. We have studied the performance of SOS, in terms of the effective
	number successful feedback one can obtain from a sensor cluster,
	using a custom developed simulator. Our results are quite encouraging
	and suggest that the aggregated reports will contain measurements
	from a high fraction of the sensor cluster, with redundancy, thus
	reinforcing the applicability of sensors in ocean related disaster

	and augment dynamic data-driven application simulations (DDDAS).
	Virtual telemetry has the advantage that it is inexpensive to produce
	from real time simulations and readily transmittable using open
	source streaming software. Real telemetry is usually expensive to
	receive (if it is even available long term), tends to be messy,
	comes in no particular order, and can be incomplete or erroneous
	due to transmission problems or sensor malfunction. We will generate
	multiple streams continuously for extended periods (e.g., months
	or years): clean data, somewhat error prone data, and quite lossy
	or inaccurate data. By studying all of the streams at once we will
	be able to devise DDDAS components useful in predictive contaminant
	modeling.},

	GPS updates and estimated gradients of the environmental fields
	(e.g., temperature) that are used to navigate the AUV fleets enabling
	effective front tracking and/or feature detection. To this effect
	these fleets are required to translate to collect and seek good
	data, expand/contract to effect changes in sensor resolution, and
	rotate and reconfigure to maximize sensing coverage, all while retaining
	a prescribed formation. These strategies play a key role in directing
	a cooperative fleet of autonomous underwater gliders in the first
	experiment of the Office of Naval Research sponsored Autonomous
	Ocean Sampling Network II (AOSN-II) project in Monterey Bay, during
	August-September 2003. We present the coordination framework and

  abstract = {For mobile robots to be successful, they have to navigate safely in
	populated and dynamic environments. While recent research has led
	to a variety of localization methods that can track robots well
	in {\em static} environments, we still lack methods that can robustly
	localize mobile robots in dynamic environments, where, for example,
	people may block the robot's sensors for extensive periods of time.
	This paper proposes a family of probabilistic algorithms that can
	localize mobile robots even in densely populated environments. These
	algorithms are based on Markov localization, which estimates the
	location of a robot probabilistically. A novel entropy-based filter
	is employed for determining the "believability" of a sensor reading,
	thereby filtering out sensor readings that are corrupted by humans
	or unexpected changes in the environment. The technique was recently
	implemented and applied as part of an installation, in which a mobile
	robot gave interactive tours to visitors of the ``Deutsches Museum
	Bonn.'' Extensive empirical tests involving datasets recorded during
	peak traffic hours in the museum demonstrate that this approach
	is able to accurately estimate the robot's position in more than
	99\% of the cases even in such highly dynamic environments. },

	enables a broad range of ubiquitous computing applications. Their

  abstract = {This paper presents two case histories of the use of wireless sensor
	Mote technologies. These are devices that incorporate communications,
	processing, sensors, sensor fusion, and power source into a package
	currently about two cubic inches in size - networked autonomous
	sensor nodes. The first case discussed is the November, 2001, instrumentation
	of a blastinduced liquefaction test in Tokachi Port, Japan. The
	second case discussed is the dense-pakTM instrumentation of the
	seismic shaking test of a full-scale wood-frame building on the
	UCB Richmond shake table. The utility of dense instumentation is
	shown, and how it allows location of damage globally unseen. A methodology
	of interpreting structural seismic respose by Bayesian updating
	and extended Kalman filtering is presented. It is shown that dense,
	inexpensive instrumentation is needed to identify structural damage
	and prognosticate future behavior. The case studies show that the
	current families of Motes are very useful, but the hardware still
	has difficulties in terms of reliability and consistancy. It is
	apparent that the TinyOS is a wonderful tool for computer science
	education but is not an industrual quality instrumentation system.
	These are, of course, growing pains of the first incarnations of
	the Berkeley Smart Dust ideal. We expect the dream of easy to use,
	inexpensive, smart, wireless, sensor networks to become a reality
	in the next couple of years. },

	the design of a high accuracy outdoor navigation system based on
	standard dead reckoning sensors and laser range and bearing information.
	The data validation problem is addressed using laser intensity information.
	The beacon design aspect and location of landmarks are also discussed
	in relation to desired accuracy and required area of operation.
	The results are important for simultaneous localization ? . and
	map building applications SLAM , since the feature extraction and
	validation are resolved at the sensor level using laser intensity.
	This facilitates the use of additional natural landmarks to improve
	the accuracy of the localization algorithm. The modeling aspects
	to implement SLAM with beacons and natural features are also presented.
	These results are of fundamental importance because the implementation
	of the algorithm does not require the surveying of beacons. Furthermore
	we demonstrate that by using natural landmarks accurate localization
	can be achieved by only requiring the initial estimate of the position
	of the vehicle. The algorithms are validated in outdoor environments
	using a standard utility car retrofitted with the navigation sensors
	and a 1 cm precision Kinematic GPS used as ground truth.},

  mynote = {Abstract: Wireless sensor networks have been used for a variety of
	applications. However, many highway and traffic applications have
	not been tapped, primarily sensor networks for highway and traffic
	algorithms that alleviate generic problems such as highway congestion.
	This is due to the fact that sensor network technology is a very
	recent development. Since sensor networks are relatively new, not
	many applications have been explored in depth. Utilizing the new
	generation of TinyOS micaboard mote sensors, miniaturized sensors
	that utilize TinyOS, an event-based operating environment written
	in code similar to stylized C, the article focuses on how to achieve
	the best possible data results from sensor network applications
	and setups for traffic/highway goals. How to use sensor-network
	graphs for optimal placement of sensors in a network so as to minimize
	work and to achieve the best possible, and most accurate, signal-strength
	localization measurements is also be a primary focus. Also discussed
	is a method that optimizes the tradeoff between energy and accuracy
	using a variety of activation policies. Finally, simulations and
	distancing experiments of indoor and outdoor data are provided to
	encourage similar sensor work.}

	and determine their performance in terms of the probabilities of
	false alarm and detection. The results are applied to the design
	of chemical sensor arrays satisfying criteria specified in terms

  abstract = {We study the problem of multiple target tracking using multiple mobile
	robots. Our approach is to divide the cooperative multi-target tracking
	problem into two sub-problems: target tracking using a single mobile
	robot and on-line motion strategy design for multi-robot coordination.
	
	
	For single robot-based tracking, we address two key challenges: how
	to separate the ego-motion of the robot from the motions of external
	objects, and how to compensate this ego-motion to detect and track
	moving objects robustly. An ego-motion compensation method using
	salient feature tracking and a probabilistic filter design to handle
	the noise and uncertainty of sensor inputs are presented. The proposed
	method has been tested in various outdoor environments using three
	different robot platforms, which have unique ego-motion characteristics.
	
	
	For multi-robot coordination, we propose an algorithm based on treating
	the densities of robots and targets as properties of the environment
	in which they are embedded. By suitably manipulating these densities
	a control law for each robot is proposed; we term our approach Region-based
	. We derive two specialized versions of the control law for the
	case when the topology of the environment is known in advance and
	the case when the environment is unstructured. These coordination
	approaches have been tested in simulation and in real robot systems.
	Experiments indicate that our treatment of the coordination problem
	based on environmental characteristics is effective and efficient.},

  abstract = {We propose an original method for robotic programming based on bayesian
	inference and learning. This method formally deals with problems
	of uncertainty and incomplete information that are inherent to the
	field. Indeed, the principal difficulties of robot programming comes
	from the unavoidable incompleteness of the models used. We present
	the formalism for describing a robotic task as well as the resolution
	methods. This formalism is inspired by the theory of the probability
	calculus, suggested by the physicist E T Jaynes: ``Probability as
	Logic''[1]. Learning and maximum entropy principle translate incompleteness
	into uncertainty. Bayesian inference offers a formal framework for
	reasoning with this uncertainty. There is quite a lot of experimental
	work involving programming robots to act under uncertainty, based
	on Bayesian inference : See for instance [2,3,4]. These works effectively
	use the Bayesian approach for accomplishing robot tasks, but they
	do not present a structured programming paradigm as the current
	paper does. The main contribution of this paper is the definition
	of a generic system of robotic programming and its experimental
	application. We illustrate it by programming a surveillance task
	with a mobile robot: The Khepera. In order to do this, we use generic
	programming resources called "descriptions". We show how to define
	and use these resources in an incremental way (reactive behaviors,
	sensor fusion, situation recognition and sequences of behaviors)
	within a systematic and unified framework. We discuss the various
	advantages of our approach: Statement of preliminary knowledge,
	taking into account uncertainty, direct and inverse programming.
	We place our work within a wider epistemological horizon while opposing,
	within the framework of autonomous robotics, the "traditional" approach
	concerning "high level cognition" and the "reactive" approach associated
	with the "low level cognition". We finally show how our work proposes
	to establish a link between these two extremes. },

  title = {Data fusion and filtering for target tracking and identification},
  school = {McMaster University},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {This thesis explores two problems in target tracking and identification:
	(1) robust track state filtering, and (2) decision-level identity
	fusion.
	
	
	In the first part of the thesis, a novel finite-horizon, discrete-time,
	time-varying state estimation method based on the robust semidefinite
	programming technique is proposed. The proposed method is robust
	to norm bounded parameter uncertainties in the system model as well
	as to uncertainties in the noise statistics. The robust performance
	of the proposed method is achieved by minimizing an upper bound
	on the worst case variance of the estimation error for all admissible
	systems.
	
	
	In the second part of the thesis, two decision-level identity fusion
	models are proposed: Similar Sensor Fusion (SSF) model and Dissimilar
	Sensor Fusion (DSF) model. In the SSF model, sensors provide reports
	on a set of common characteristics of a target, and the fusion objective
	is to find a fusion result which is most consistent with all the
	sensor reports. In comparison, sensors in the DSF model explore
	different characteristics of a target. Their reports are fused in
	a manner that leads to decreased uncertainty on the target identity.
	In other words, these reports reinforce each other to generate increased
	certainty on the target identity, rather than being averaged to
	minimize inconsistency. Furthermore, we propose several fundamental
	principles for identity fusion, based on which all existing and
	future identity fusion methods can be evaluated and compared.
	
	
	For the SSF model, two fusion methods are proposed: Convex quadratic
	fusion method and K-L fusion method. In the first method, inconsistencies
	between the fusion result and the sensor reports are measured by
	quadratic functions, and the problem is formulated as a convex quadratic
	programming problem. In the second method, Kullback-Leibler distance
	is used to measure the inconsistencies among the probabilistic sensor
	reports. The resulting formulation leads to a generalized analytic
	center problem.
	
	
	For the DSF model, we use a special objective function in the optimization
	formulation to accumulate the physical characteristics on a target
	explored by each sensor. The resulting fusion method involves solving
	an analytic center problem.
	
	
	Compared with the two classical decision-level identity fusion methods:
	Bayesian inference method and Dempster-Shafer evidential inference
	method, the three new fusion methods require no a priori information
	on the target, and enjoy small computation complexity. In addition,
	we show that the three new fusion methods, as well as the two classical
	methods, all satisfy the fundamental principles for identity fusion.
	The performance of the proposed fusion methods are illustrated in
	several numerical examples.},

	Communication cost is modeled as the power consumption
	
	needed to deliver collected data from sensor nodes, thus trading
	
	off sensing coverage and communication cost. The control

  abstract = {As a sub-task of the general gas source localisation problem, gas
	source tracing is supposed to guide a gas-sensitive mobile system
	towards a source by using the cues determined from the gas distribution
	sensed along a driven path. This paper reports on an investigation
	of a biologically inspired gas source tracing strategy. Similar
	to the behaviour of the silkworm moth Bombyx mori, the implemented
	behaviour consists of a fixed motion pattern that realises a local
	search, and a mechanism that (re-)starts this motion pattern if
	an increased gas concentration is sensed. While the moth uses the
	local airflow direction to orient the motion pattern, this is not
	possible for a mobile robot due to the detection limits of currently
	available anemometers. Thus, an alternative method was implemented
	that uses an asymmetric motion pattern, which is biased towards
	the side where higher gas sensor readings were obtained. The adaptated
	strategy was implemented and tested on an experimental platform.
	This paper describes the strategy and evaluates its performance
	in terms of the ability to drive the robot towards a gas source
	and to keep it within close proximity of the source. Ref 1. Peter

  month = Mar,
  abstract = {Wireless ad hoc sensor networks have the advantage of spanning a large
	geographical region and being able to collaboratively detect and
	track non-local spatiotemporal events. This paper presents a dual-space
	approach to event tracking and sensor resource management in sensor
	networks. An implemented application of detecting and tracking light
	shadow edges moving over a sensor field is described. The dual-space
	transformation maps a non-local phenomenon, e.g., the edge of a
	half-plane shadow, to a single point in the dual space, and maps
	locations of distributed sensor nodes to a set of lines that partitions
	the dual space. The detection problem becomes finding and tracking
	the cell that contains the point in the arrangement defined by these
	lines. This mechanism can be effectively used for power management
	of the sensor network ? nodes that will not be immediately visited
	by the shadow can be turned off to save energy. The approach has
	been successfully demonstrated on a laboratory testbed built using
	the UC Berkeley sensor motes.

	coverage for an ad hoc sensor network is fundamental to the deployment

	phenomenon of interest occurs. Its value at any given point reflects
	the ability of the sensor network to estimate the phenomenon and/or
	event, of interest at this point. A statistical method is presented
	to determine such a field based on sensor layouts and sensor models.

	and sensor holes, information that can be used to characterize the
	quality of service that the network provides for different applications.

  mynote = {In IEEE's proposed standard for wireless LANs (IEEE 802.11), there
	are two different ways to configure a network: ad-hoc and infrastructure.
	In the ad-hoc network, computers are brought together to form a
	network "on the fly." there is no structure to the network; there
	are no fixed points; and usually every node is able to communicate
	with every other node. A good example of this is the aforementioned
	meeting where employees bring laptop computers together to communicate
	and share design or financial information. Although it seems that
	order would be difficult to maintain in this type of network, algorithms
	such as the spokesman election algorithm (SEA) [4] have been designed
	to "elect" one machine as the base station (master) of the network
	with the others being slaves. Another algorithm in ad-hoc network
	architectures uses a broadcast and flooding method to all other
	nodes to establish who's who. the second type of network structure
	used in wireless LANs is the infrastructure. This architecture uses
	fixed network access points with which mobile nodes can communicate.
	These network access points are sometime connected to landlines
	to widen the LAN's capability by bridging wireless nodes to other
	wired nodes. If service areas overlap, handoffs can occur. This
	structure is very similar to the present day cellular networks around
	the world. },

  school = {Georgia Institute of Technology},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {Design of nonlinear observers has received considerable attention
	since the early development of methods for linear state estimation.
	The most popular approach is the extended Kalman filter (EKF), that
	goes through significant degradation in the presence of nonlinearities,
	particularly if unmodeled dynamics are coupled to the process and
	the measurement. For uncertain nonlinear systems, adaptive observers
	have been introduced to estimate the unknown state variables where
	no priori information about the unknown parameters is available.
	While establishing global results, these approaches are applicable
	only to systems transformable to output feedback form. Over the
	recent years, neural network (NN) based identification and estimation
	schemes have been proposed that relax the assumptions on the system
	at the price of sacrificing on the global nature of the results.
	However, most of the NN based adaptive observer approaches in the
	literature require knowledge of the full dimension of the system,
	therefore may not be suitable for systems with unmodeled dynamics.
	We first propose a novel approach to nonlinear state estimation
	from the perspective of augmenting a linear time invariant observer
	with an adaptive element. The class of nonlinear systems treated
	here are finite but of otherwise unknown dimension. The objective
	is to improve the performance of the linear observer when applied
	to a nonlinear system. The approach relies on the ability of the
	NNs to approximate the unknown dynamics from finite time histories
	of available measurements. Next we investigate nonlinear state estimation
	from the perspective of adaptively augmenting an existing time varying
	observer, such as an EKF. EKFs find their applications mostly in
	target tracking problems. The proposed approaches are robust to
	unmodeled dynamics, including unmodeled disturbances. Lastly, we
	consider the problem of adaptive estimation in the presence of feedback
	control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with unmodeled
	dynamics and disturbances coupled to the process. The states from
	the adaptive EKF are used as inputs to the control law, which in
	target tracking usually takes the form of a guidance law. The applications
	of this approach lie in the areas of missile-target tracking, formation
	flight control and obstacle avoidance.},

  abstract = {Abstract??n this paper, the inverse dynamics method for generating
	feedforward inputs and reference trajectories to achieve exact tracking
	for general linear time-invariant multiinput??ultioutput (MIMO)
	systems is explicitly derived. The method is applied to the task
	of generating input powers to achieve exact temperature tracking
	(ETT) at multiple locations within a tumor during hyperthermia treatments.
	The inverse dynamics method, which uses the system dynamics to generate
	the feedforward inputs necessary to achieve exact tracking in the
	absence of modeling errors, initial condition errors, and disturbances,
	is applied in conjunction with standard feedback control. This technique
	is compared to the standard tracking controller which uses the desired
	trajectory as the reference trajectory. A number of important issues
	are considered: 1) robustness of the control schemes to parameter
	variation; 2) effect of additive sensor and actuator noise; 3) effect
	of using reduced order model estimators, which is often necessary
	for high-order systems resulting from finite element method models
	commonly used in hyperthermia and large structure control; and 4)
	effect of fast desired trajectories on the accuracy of output tracking.
	The fourth issue is especially important since achieving any desired
	trajectory leads to dose prescribability, a key component to achieving
	increased clinical acceptance of hyperthermia. The inverse dynamics
	method is shown to be significantly more accurate when fast trajectories
	are desired. The results of this simulation study show that model-based
	inverse dynamics control has promise for clinical application. In
	particular, inverse dynamics has the potential to become a useful
	tool for increasing treatment prescribability, increasing treatment
	efficiency, and decreasing patient pain. In addition, the inverse
	dynamics method as derived here can be applied to any other general
	linear MIMO system.},

  abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map
	its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite
	of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem
	scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in
	real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example,
	require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate
	each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm
	that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over
	robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with
	the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a
	factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark
	distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm
	has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments
	far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results
	demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm
	on both simulated and real-world data. },

  mynote = { operate. TCP was originally designed for wired networks, where loss
	of data is assumed to be due to congestion only. This assumption
	leads to poor performance of TCP in a wireless environment. Hence,
	various mechanisms were proposed to improve TCP performance over
	wireless links. One such mechanism is a performance enhancing proxy,
	such as the Snoop protocol. In this paper, we study the effect of
	the Snoop protocol on the performance of TCP over wireless links.
	We implemented and simulated Snoop protocol in OPNET wireless LAN
	(WLAN) devices. We measured the performance improvement by comparing
	the performance of an FTP session with and without the Snoop protocol.
	We found that the Snoop protocol significantly improves the performance
	of TCP (~ 68 times under 30\% packet error rate). We show that this
	improvement is achieved by preventing the TCP layer from reducing
	the congestion window size.},

	of the wire it is attached to, is not synchronized to other sensors
	and does not need configuration of triggering levels. The main novelty
	of the concept is in detecting and locating faults by combining
	power distribution network characteristics on system level with
	low power sampling methods for individual sensors. This concept
	enables the sensor design to be simple, energy efficient and thus
	applicable in new installations and for retrofit purposes in both
	overhead and underground electrical distribution systems.},

	by using the existence and uniqueness theorem, the comparison theorem

	Finally, some numerical examples for the optimal sensor location

	systems (DPS) with spatially varying parameters described by partial
	differential equations (PDEs) of parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic
	type. The features of the PDE setting are utilized to obtain the
	not directly intuitive parameter estimation algorithms that use
	spatial derivatives of the output data with the order reduced from
	that of the highest spatial plant derivative. The tunable identifier
	parameters are passed through the integrator block, which forms
	their orthogonal expansions. The latter are shown to be pointwise
	plant parameter estimates. In this regard, the approach of the paper
	is in the spirit of finite-dimensional observer realization in integrating
	rather than differentiating the output data, only applied to the
	spatial rather than temporal domain. The constructively enforceable
	identifiability conditions, formulated in terms of the sufficiently
	rich input signals referred to as generators of persistent excitation,
	are shown to guarantee the existence of a unique zero steady state
	for the parameter errors. Under such inputs, the tunable parameters
	in the adaptive identifiers proposed are shown to converge to plant
	parameters in L2 and the orthogonal expansions of these tunable
	parameters-pointwise},

  title = {Estimation and path planning for cooperative multi-vehicle systems},
  school = {Cornell University},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {This work examines the relationship between path planning and cooperative
	estimation for multi-vehicle systems. A unified approach to cooperative
	estimation and path planning for multiple vehicles is presented.
	Cooperative estimation is employed in target tracking, where the
	estimates from different vehicles are combined to reduce target
	uncertainties. Target state information is estimated and integrated
	into a path planning framework. An evolutionary computation based
	planner is used to illustrate vehicle trajectories as they travel
	through an obstacle field. By using information from cooperative
	estimation to identify obstacle locations, vehicles are able to
	avoid obstacles while they travel to goal locations. A cooperative
	estimation approach among vehicles is shown to improve speed and
	routing of the path.
	
	
	Because cooperative estimation significantly depends on vehicle trajectories,
	it is important to take cooperation into account in path planning
	in order to take a full advantage of multiple vehicles. This work
	particularly focuses on cooperative reconnaissance, where the common
	objective of the team is to gather as much information on targets
	as possible. First, a simple case involving two vehicles is studied
	optimally in order to gain a greater understanding of cooperative
	vehicle behavior in reconnaissance. The work makes use of information
	theory to guide the vehicles over paths using a numerical solution
	to the optimal control problem. The effects of triangulation, distance,
	and planning time horizon, are examined. Using the knowledge from
	the simple cases, along with a multiple task assignment algorithm,
	an approximate cooperative reconnaissance methodology is developed.
	Given a set of targets and vehicles, the methodology plans both
	the trajectories and task assignments. In multiple task assignment,
	vehicles are assigned to a set of targets using trajectory primitives
	based on the cost, function. Additional work on clustering and cost
	bounding are used to alleviate the computational load, while maintaining
	performance.},

	of randomly vibrating structures using information from a limited
	number of measurements. The objective is to optimize the locations
	of sensors for the purpose of making the most accurate predictions
	of the response at unmeasured locations in structural systems. The
	kriging method is used to find the response predictions and the
	corresponding mean-square errors at unmeasured locations. The mean-square
	errors in the predictions depend on the locations of sensors and
	the correlation characteristics of the response evaluated from the
	model of dynamics and the characteristics of the excitation. The
	response predictions depend also on the information contained in
	measurements. The optimal sensor locations are selected to minimize
	the total mean-square error of the response predictions at unmeasured
	points. This leads to a complicated non-convex optimization problem
	in which multiple local and global optima may exist. A hybrid optimization
	method based on evolution strategies is used to determine a global
	minimum. The optimal experimental design method presented in the
	paper is illustrated by designing the optimal sensor locations for
	an elastic beam and a plate subjected to a class of random stationary
	loads.},

	estimate from each microphone array which yields an improved estimate
	of the positions and velocities of multiple, simultaneously active,
	moving speakers based on time delay of arrivals (TDOAs). Our approach:
	1) incorporates kinematic information of moving speakers by using
	an interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator for each speaker in
	order to constrain the evolution of the location measurements; 2)
	fuses the location estimates of the same speaker from multiple microphone
	arrays for better acoustical coverage of the sensed environment,
	and 3) directly accounts for the measurement origin uncertainty,
	i.e., which measurement comes from which speaker by using the probabilistic
	data association (PDA) technique with the IMM estimator. We demonstrate
	that a network of arrays combined with the estimation technique
	widely used in multisensor multitarget tracking area provides a
	consistent and coherent way to reduce the uncertainty and ambiguity
	of measurements. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated
	by extensive simulation study on tracking a single moving speaker
	and two closely-spaced speakers with a crossing segment in their
	trajectories.},

  title = {Some new algorithms for multiple maneuvering target tracking},
  school = {Auburn University},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {Target tracking is the processing of noise-corrupted measurements
	obtained from a target in order to maintain an estimate of its current
	state. In this dissertation we develop a set of new suboptimal filtering
	and smoothing algorithms for maneuvering target tracking application.
	The proposed algorithms provide better performance in terms of estimation
	accuracy over the existing algorithms.
	
	
	The dissertation is organized in five parts: (1) We propose a novel
	suboptimal filtering algorithm for the problem of tracking multiple
	maneuvering targets in the presence of clutter. In the proposed
	algorithm, we exploit the multiscan joint probabilistic data association
	(Mscan-JPDA) approach to address the measurement-to-track association
	problem. Earlier work on the multiscan JPDA is restricted to non-maneuvering
	targets, in which single kinematic model is used to model the motion
	behavior of the target. We use switching multiple model approach
	in which distinct kinematic models describe the motion of the target
	and switching among these models is governed by a Markov chain.
	We then exploit the basic interacting multiple model (IMM) approach
	for multiple model estimation. (2) We extend the proposed IMM/Mscan-JPDA
	filtering algorithm to the fixed-lag smoothing case in which the
	objective is to obtain the state estimates at time k when given
	the measurements up to time k + d ( d > 0 and is fixed). The smoothing
	algorithm achieves significant improvement in the estimation accuracy
	over the filtering algorithm, by introducing a small time lag between
	the instants of estimation and latest measurements. (3) We extend
	the proposed IMM/Mscan-JPDA filtering algorithm to a multisensor
	tracking scenario. We carry out sequential updating of the state
	by obtaining measurements from the multiple sensors. (4) We consider
	the problem of scheduling multiple sensors for a maneuvering target
	tracking application. Tracking of highly maneuvering target is achieved
	by an effective suboptimal filtering algorithm based on the IMM
	filtering approach combined with the probabilistic data association
	(PDA) technique and the proposed sensor scheduling algorithm. (5)
	We propose a new adaptive sampling policy for a maneuvering target
	tracking application. Multisensor tracking is achieved by a suboptimal
	filtering algorithm developed by the IMM/PDA filter combined with
	the proposed adaptive sampling scheme. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

	problem, namely collective localization. A group of M robots is
	viewed as a single system composed of robots that carry, in general,
	different sensors and have different positioning capabilities. A
	single Kalman filter is formulated to estimate the position and
	orientation of all the members of the group. This centralized schema
	is capable of fusing information provided by the sensors distributed
	on the individual robots while accommodating independencies and
	.interdependencies among the collected data. In order to allow for
	distributed processing, the equations of the centralized Kalman
	filter are treated so that this filter can be decomposed in M modified
	Ii-alman filters each running on a separate robot. The collective
	localization algorithm is applied to a group of 3 robots and the
	improvement in localization accuracy as presented.},

	making possible the design of the controller once any one of them
	is known. It is also remarkable that for the estimation of non-mea
	surable states a full rank observer is proposed, and the fact that
	its poles are equal to the roots of the filter poly nomials Tt(z-i)
	can also be appreciated. },

  abstract = {We consider the problem of a user searching for information over a
	sensor network, where the user does not have prior knowledge of
	the location of the information. We consider three information search
	strategies: i) a source-only search, where the source (user) tries
	to locate the destination by initiating search which propagates
	as a continuous time random walk (Brownian motion); ii) a source
	and receiver driven "sticky" search, where both the source and the
	destination send a search or an advertisement, and these leave a
	"sticky" trail to aid in locating the destination; and iii) where
	the destination information is spatially cached (i.e., repeated
	over space), and the source tries to locate any one of the caches.
	After a random interval of time with average t, if the information
	is not located, the search times-out, and the search is unsuccessful.
	For a source-only search, we show that the probability that a search
	is unsuccessful decays as (log(t))/sup -1/. When both the source
	and the destination send search packets or advertisements, we show
	that the probability that a search is unsuccessful decays as t/sup
	-5/8/. Further, faster polynomial decay rates can be achieved by
	using a finite number of searches or advertisements. Finally, when
	a spatially periodic cache is employed, we show that the probability
	that a search is unsuccessful decays no faster than t/sup -1/. Thus,
	we can match the decay rates of the source and the destination driven
	search with that of a spatial caching strategy by using an appropriate
	number of search packets. The sticky search as well as caching utilize
	memory that is spatially distributed over the network. We show that
	spreading the memory over space leads to a decrease in memory requirement,
	while maintaining a polynomial decay in the search failure probability.
	In particular, we show that the memory requirement for spatial caching
	is larger (in an order sense) than that for sticky searches. This
	indicates that the appropriate strategy for searching over large
	sensor networks with little infrastructure support would be to use
	multiple search packets and advertisements using the sticky search
	strategy.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present new analytical, simulated, and experimental
	results on the performance of relative location estimation in multihop
	wireless sensor networks. With relative location, node locations
	are estimated based on the collection of peer-to-peer ranges between
	nodes and their neighbors using a priori knowledge of the location
	of a small subset of nodes, called reference nodes. This paper establishes
	that when applying relative location to multihop networks the resulting
	location accuracy has a fundamental upper bound that is determined
	by such system parameters as the number of hops and the number of
	links to the reference nodes. This is in contrast to the case of
	single-hop or fully connected systems where increasing the node
	density results in continuously increasing location accuracy. More
	specifically, in multihop networks for a fixed number of hops, as
	sensor nodes are added to the network the overall location accuracy
	improves converging toward a fixed asymptotic value that is determined
	by the total number of links to the reference nodes, whereas for
	a fixed number of links to the reference nodes, the location accuracy
	of a node decreases the greater the number of hops from the reference
	nodes. Analytical expressions are derived from one-dimensional networks
	for these fundamental relationships that are also validated in two-dimensional
	and three-dimensional networks with simulation and UWB measurement
	results.},

	learn what features/landmarks are best suited for localization,
	and also to train artificial neural networks for extracting them
	from the sensor data. A rigorous Bayesian analysis of probabilistic

	evaluating features, for selecting them optimally, and for training
	the networks that approximate the optimal solution. In a systematic

  abstract = {Mobile robot localization is the problem of determining a robot's
	pose from sensor data. Monte Carlo Localization is a family of algorithms
	for localization based on particle filters, which are approximate
	Bayes filters that use random samples for posterior estimation.
	Recently, they have been applied with great success for robot localization.
	Unfortunately, regular particle filters perform poorly in certain
	situations. Mixture-MCL, the algorithm described here, overcomes
	these problems by using a ``dual'' sampler, integrating two complimentary
	ways of generating samples in the estimation. To apply this algorithm
	for mobile robot localization, a kd-tree is learned from data that
	permits fast dual sampling. Systematic empirical results obtained
	using data collected in crowded public places illustrate superior
	performance, robustness, and efficiency, when compared to other
	state-of-the-art localization algorithms. He thought: The nature
	of small, incremental errors makes algorithms such as Kalman filters
	[28,37,47,68] applicable, which have been successfully applied in
	a range of fielded systems (e.g., [27,44,42,63]). Kalman filters
	estimate posterior distributions of robot poses conditioned on sensor
	data. Exploiting a range of restrictive assumptions??such as Gaussian-distributed
	noise and Gaussiandistributed initial uncertainty??they represent
	posteriors by Gaussians. Kalman filters offer an elegant and efficient
	algorithm for localization. However, the restrictive nature of the
	belief representation makes plain Kalman filters inapplicable to
	global localization problems. This limitation is overcome by two
	related families of algorithms: Localization with multi-hypothesis
	Kalman filters and Markov localization. Multi-hypothesis Kalman
	filters represent beliefs using mixtures of Gaussians [9,34,60,61],
	thereby enabling them to pursue multiple, distinct hypotheses, each
	of which is represented by a separate Gaussian. However, this approach
	inherits from Kalman filters the Gaussian noise assumption. To meet
	this assumption, virtually all practical implementations extract
	low-dimensional features from the sensor data, thereby ignoring
	much of the information acquired by a robot??s sensors. Markov localization
	algorithms, in contrast, represent beliefs by piecewise constant
	functions (histograms) over the space of all possible poses [7,24,30,36,40,50,55,56,66,70].\url{http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/thrun/public_html/papers.html}},

	pose from sensor data. Monte Carlo Localization is a family of algorithms
	for localization based on particle filters, which are approximate
	Bayes filters that use random samples for posterior estimation.
	Recently, they have been applied with great success for robot localization.
	Unfortunately, regular particle filters perform poorly in certain
	situations. Mixture-MCL, the algorithm described here, overcomes
	these problems by using a "dual" sampler, integrating two complimentary
	ways of generating samples in the estimation. To apply this algorithm
	for mobile robot localization, a kd-tree is learned from data that
	permits fast dual sampling. Systematic empirical results obtained
	using data collected in crowded public places illustrate superior
	performance, robustness, and efficiency, when compared to other
	state-of-the-art localization algorithms. },

	(EM) is employed to learn models from data. Regularization during
	learning is achieved using an exponential shrinking technique. The
	shrinkage factor, which determines the effective capacity of the
	learning algorithm, is annealed down over multiple iterations of
	Baum-Welch, and early stopping is applied to select the right model.
	Once trained, Monte Carlo HMMs can be run in an any-time fashion.
	We prove that under mild assumptions, Monte Carlo Hidden Markov
	Models converge to a local maximum in likelihood space, just like

	analysis is considered. The measurements are target bearings obtained

	the initial states of targets. The overall problem is formulated
	using the maximum likelihood principle. A two-step iterative method
	is proposed to maximize the joint likelihood, a nonlinear least-squares
	method is used to fit the trajectory estimates to the measurements
	for given data associations, and the linear assignment algorithm
	is used to solve the data associations for given trajectory estimates.
	A stochastic relaxation method based on simulated annealing is proposed
	to augment the second step so that the global maximum of the likelihood
	function can be located. Monte Carlo simulations are included to
	evaluate the joint estimator. The Cramer-Rao lower bound of the
	initial state estimate is derived in the presence of data association
	uncertainties},

  mynote = {The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has become a standard technique used
	in a number of nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications.
	These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system,
	estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g.,
	learning the weights of a neural network), and dual estimation (e.g.,
	the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) where both states and
	parameters are estimated simultaneously. This paper points out the
	flaws in using the EKF, and introduces an improvement, the Unscented
	Kalman Filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman [5]. A central
	and vital operation performed in the Kalman Filter is the propagation
	of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics.
	In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which
	is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization
	of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the
	true posterior mean and covariance of the transform...},

	in a sensor network since the nodes are typically deployed in an
	ad-hoc manner into an infrastructure-less terrain. When beacons
	are used for localization, there are two critical design issues:
	1) to maximize the lifetime of the beacons and 2) to maximize the
	coverage area. With clustering, the goal is to minimize the energy
	dissipation of the sensor network. In this paper, we consider the
	placement of beacons and data loggers (that act as cluster heads)
	in the Cosumnes River Preserve, which is a joint collaborative restoration
	project between the Cosumnes Research Consortium at University of
	California at Davis (UCD) and The Nature Conservancy. Currently,
	there are many types of sensors deployed in the preserve which are
	wired to data loggers. Our objective is to determine the minimum
	number and placement of beacons and data loggers for wireless sensors
	deployed in the preserve. We formulated an optimization problem
	which is solved by integer linear program (ILP).},

	the field of fluid mechanics. The algorithm is applied by a network
	of mobile sensing agents (e.g., robots or micro-air vehicles) that
	sense the ambient fluid velocity and chemical concentration, and
	calculate derivatives. The algorithm drives the robotic network
	to the source of the toxic plume, where measures can be taken to
	disable the source emitter. This work is part of a much larger effort
	in research and development of a physics-based approach to developing

  volume = { 47},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {This paper surveys several topics related to the observation and control
	of wave propagation phenomena modeled by finite difference methods.
	The main focus is on the property of observability, corresponding
	to the question of whether the total energy of solutions can be
	estimated from partial measurements on a subregion of the domain
	or boundary. The mathematically equivalent property of controllability
	corresponds to the question of whether wave propagation behavior
	can be controlled using forcing terms on that subregion, as is often
	desired in engineering applications. Observability/controllability
	of the continuous wave equation is well understood for the scalar
	linear constant coefficient case that is the focus of this paper.
	However, when the wave equation is discretized by finite difference
	methods, the control for the discretized model does not necessarily
	yield a good approximation to the control for the original continuous
	problem. In other words, the classical convergence (consistency
	+ stability) property of a numerical scheme does not suffice to
	guarantee its suitability for providing good approximations to the
	controls that might be needed in applications. Observability/controllability
	may be lost under numerical discretization as the mesh size tends
	to zero due to the existence of high-frequency spurious solutions
	for which the group velocity vanishes. This phenomenon is analyzed
	and several remedies are suggested, including filtering, Tychonoff
	regularization, multigrid methods, and mixed finite element methods.
	We also briefly discuss these issues for the heat, beam, and SchrÃ¯Â¿Â½odinger
	equations to illustrate that diffusive and dispersive effects may
	help to retain the observability/controllability properties at the},

	Implementation oriented, this volume explores the fundamentals of
	UWB technology with particular emphasis on impulse radio (IR) techniques.
	It explains the key physical layer aspects of UWB technology, especially
	in communications and in control applications, and examines the
	multiple access (MAC) issues which are emerging as a hot area for
	practical UWB systems.
	
	
	 * Offers practical information about implementation
	
	 * Addresses issues of modulation possibilities, appropriate circuits
	for UWB, an example circuit design, MAC protocol issues and use
	of UWB for positioning applications
	
	 * Includes a literature survey examining books, articles and conference
	papers presenting the basic features of UWB technology and current
	systems
	
	 * Features a patent database search providing a historical perspective
	to the state-of-the-art technology 
	
	
	UWB Theory and Applications will be indispensable to researchers interested
	in the practical issues of UWB technology and realistic assumptions
	of UWB, as well as engineers interested in implementing UWB devices.},

@MISC{PatentThemoPower,
  title = {Thermoelectric power from environmental temperature cycles},
  howpublished = {United States Patent 6914343},
  abstract = {An electric generator system for producing electric power from the
	environmental temperature changes such as occur during a normal
	summer day on Earth or Mars. In a preferred embodiment a phase-change
	mass is provided which partially or completely freezes during the
	relatively cold part of a cycle and partially or completely melts
	during the relatively hot part of the cycle. A thermoelectric module
	is positioned between the phase-change mass and the environment.
	The temperature of the phase-change mass remains relatively constant
	throughout the cycle. During the hot part of the cycle heat flows
	from the environment through the thermoelectric module into the
	phase change mass generating electric power which is stored in an
	electric power storage device such as a capacitor or battery. During
	the cold part of the cycle heat flows from the phase change mass
	back through the module and out to the environment also generating
	electric power that also is similarly stored. An electric circuit
	is provided with appropriate diodes to switch the direction of the
	current between the hot and cold parts of the cycle. A preferred
	phase change mass is a solution of water and ammonia that has freeze
	points between about 270 K to about 145 K depending on the water
	ammonia ratio. Preferably, a finned unit is provided to efficiently
	transfer heat from a module surface to the environment.},

@MISC{WiFiDef,
  title = {Wi-Fi},
  mynote = {Wi-Fi Last modified: Friday, January 16, 2004 Short for wireless fidelity
	and is meant to be used generically when referring of any type of
	802.11 network, whether 802.11b, 802.11a, dual-band, etc. The term
	is promulgated by the Wi-Fi Alliance. Any products tested and approved
	as "Wi-Fi Certified" (a registered trademark) by the Wi-Fi Alliance
	are certified as interoperable with each other, even if they are
	from different manufacturers. A user with a "Wi-Fi Certified" product
	can use any brand of access point with any other brand of client
	hardware that also is certified. Typically, however, any Wi-Fi product
	using the same radio frequency (for example, 2.4GHz for 802.11b
	or 11g, 5GHz for 802.11a) will work with any other, even if not
	"Wi-Fi Certified." Formerly, the term "Wi-Fi" was used only in place
	of the 2.4GHz 802.11b standard, in the same way that "Ethernet"
	is used in place of IEEE 802.3. The Alliance expanded the generic
	use of the term in an attempt to stop confusion about wireless LAN
	interoperability. Also see the Wireless LAN Standards chart in the
	Quick Reference section of Webopedia.},
